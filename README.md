OOP Assignments in Python

This project contains two assignments designed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python: classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

📱 Assignment 1: Smartphone Class

Parent Class: Device (brand, model)

Child Class: Smartphone (inherits from Device)

Concepts Used:

Constructors (__init__) for unique values

Inheritance (Smartphone extends Device)

Encapsulation (method upgrade_storage() safely increases storage)

Custom methods like call()

Example output:

Samsung Galaxy S23
Calling 0712345678... 📞
Storage upgraded! Now you have 256GB.

🎭 Assignment 2: Polymorphism with Vehicles

Parent Class: Vehicle (base class with move())

Child Classes: Car, Plane, Boat

Each child class overrides move() with its own behavior.

Example output:

The car is driving 🚗
The plane is flying ✈️
The boat is sailing ⛵
